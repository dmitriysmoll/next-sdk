<p>There are many nonverbal signs you can use to let those in your office know how you feel about them. You can leave a sticky note saying ""Good Job"" on their monitor. You can put laxatives in their coffee. Or, you can do as the ninjas done did: stick an angry note on their cubicle wall with throwing stars. Of course not real throwing stars, but <em>Ninja Star Push Pins</em>.</p>
<p>Each set will bring you three Ninja Stars of posting doom. Each star has one corner cut off and replaced with two push pins, so when they are embedded in the wall (or cork board or foam board) they look like they were thrown with great force. And apart from looking cool in the wall, the stories of how the <em>Ninja Star Push Pins</em> got there in the first place will quickly become the things of office legend - because nothing adds emphasis to a sign or note like a Ninja Star.</p>
<h6>Ninja Star Push Pins</h6>
<ul>
<li>These push pins make it look like your office space has been attacked by a bunch of ninjas. </li>
<li>Made of injection molded ABS with a chrome plated finish. </li>
<li>Three Ninja Star Push Pins per set. </li>

<p>In the future, astronauts will be accompanied by tiny robot companions.

<p>The Space Man Moppel is the perfect buddy for the sci-fi lover. Each foot has two power magnets, so the Space Man can stand in almost any pose, any direction, and any gravity! The arms, legs, and neck are super bendy, too. One hand is molded to hold a cable or two, and the other is a strong alligator clip for securing notes, thin wires, or anything else your mind can imagine. With a push of the button, your Space Man Moppel's head will illuminate an area of your workspace in a soft, white, LED glow. And there is nothing as lovely as an LED glow.</p>

<p>In the year 1,000BC, aliens from Uranus landed on Earth. They didn't find anyone cool to talk to, so they just added graffiti to the countryside and left. That graffiti is Stonehenge. Since that time, druids and scientists have tried to provide meaning to the awe inspiring stones, but have never riddled out the true message. We have. How? We can't tell you. What does Stonehenge really say? <em>That</em>, we can tell you. It says... ""WTF?"" in Uranean.</p>
<p>This kit will help you spread the joys of an extraterrestrial WTF? to your home or office. The largest stone is about 1.5"" tall, so that the entire structure can neatly surround your coffee mug. <em>But how will I know which stones go where?</em>, you ask. Simple, we reply with a smile, there is a puzzle/map/Stonehenge base which is included. All the stones are numbered, so it's real easy to assemble properly. You also get a little book with tons of information on what scientists think Stonehenge was all about - but now you'll know the truth.</p>
<p>The Set includes: 16 stone replicas, puzzle map/base, and 1 Mini Book. Perfect for Spinal Tap dioramas, too.</p>

<p>The oldest drums discovered (so far) have been from around 6000BC. What this means is pretty clear: humans like hitting things; humans like music; and humans like hitting things to make music. We like hitting things too - and we love music. So good thing for everyone we found these Finger Drums. Stop hitting your mugs and monitor and telephone with pens and start tapping a real beat on your Finger Drums drum set.</p>
<p>Each drum set features five touch sensitive percussive instruments. You get three smaller drums (snare and two toms), bass drum (with working pedal), and crash cymbal. All you have to do is hit them with your fingers to get a beat a-rockin'. You'll also get a mini light show, as each drum (and cymbal) lights up on impact. And the super cool thing is the record feature. Got a good riff going? Then record it and play it back ad nausuem. This feature has many uses, but we find it's perfect for joke telling. Record your own sting and play it back after each punch line. Drums make all jokes funnier. Even yours.</p>
<p>Finger Drums are approx. 6.5"" X 5.5"" X 3"" and use 3 AAA batteries (included).</p>

And keep in mind, a Slinky is not just a toy; it can be a great tool to show science stuff - like wave motion. So learn and play with Slinky. It's more than just a spring; it's a wonderful thing!</p>

<p>When trying to solve The Cube, you had to train your brain to keep track of individual tiles as they travelled around the six-sided surface. So, you think that if we reduce the number of sides to four it might be easier? Think again!</p>
<p>This colorful pyramid puzzle features four sides and four axes of rotation, but wait! Pull the points apart, and your pyramid turns inside out! Now you have a different set of colors, and the orientation of your original colored tiles will immediately come into question. Was that blue tile over here, or over there? Wait, where did that red one go, then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With only thirty-five million combinations, it should be a piece of cake, right? You'll just have to try it and see for yourself just how turned around you can get. I wouldn't be surprised if you were able to get all four sides to match up, but flip the tiles over and you may discover that the other side is all jumbled again! Clearly, your work is not done yet!</p>

<p>Being cold isn't fun. Vampires know this. That's one of the reasons they drink blood - to keep warm. Well, to celebrate the joys of being a vampire and to help keep your hands warm this winter, we bring you the perfectly named Heart Hand Warmer. But unlike most hand warmers, this one you can use over and over again. And, you don't have to pop it in the microwave to heat up.</p>
<p>The magic with the heart hand warmer is in the metal disc you see inside it. All you do is click the disc back and forth a few times and you'll see the clearish gel inside become opaque. As the opaqueness spreads, so does the heat! It's a crazy chemical reaction which we like to call AWESOME! Seriously, the pretty red gel is a supersaturated solution. Bending the disc starts an exothermic crystallization of the gel (i.e. it goes opaque and gets hot). And when it loses its warmth, all you have to do is wrap it in a towel and throw it into boiling water for about 15-20 minutes and the Heart Hand Warmer resets itself. Once it cools off from its boiling bath, it is ready to be used again. A great, fun way to keep your fingers warm this winter. Got a chilly butt? Then slip it in your back pocket. Just be careful when you sit down.</p>
<p>Dimensions: approx 3.75"" wide</p>
<p>Added Bonus: You can pop the heart hand warmer in the fridge for a few hours and use it as a cooling pack too!</p>

It's an insult to R/C toys everywhere. But luckily this 1:12 scale R/C Ducati Racing Motorcycle needs no extra help to balance and looks sharp with intricate detail and racing logos. It features fully proportional digital control with working suspension.</p>
<p>However this Ducati's main claim to fame is an animated rider who turns his head and leans into each turn. Not simply cosmetic, the weight of the rider actually causes the bike to lean and go into a turn. It's great stuff and looks awesome zipping across your office parking lot.</p>

Created by ThinkGeek</h5>
<p>Here at ThinkGeek it seems like no matter how many little R/C helicopters we fly, we're always looking for a new high with the next greatest model. Which is why we decided to kick the vicious copter cycle and go ahead and create the perfect micro indoor helicopter. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter is an original ThinkGeek creation combining a futuristic drop-ship style design with precise flying characteristics and an innovative rear propeller system. Plus it just happens to be the smallest 3-channel R/C copter we've ever seen. So go ahead, enjoy the fruits of our helicopter obsession... we don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>Precise Control</strong><br />The secret of the incredible stability of the Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter comes down to the torque control afforded by the dual rotor design. A traditional helicopter with only one rotor generates massive torque when the top blade spins. Normally this would cause the copter to spin out of control, but the rotor on the tail is designed to offset this torque. Therefore piloting a traditional helicopter involves constantly adjusting the tail speed whenever you increase the speed of the top rotor... difficult and time consuming to learn. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter has dual rotors on the top which spin in opposite directions. These opposite spinning blades cancel out uncontrolled torque making for incredibly stable flight. For forward and reverse motion the tail rotor then blows up or down, pitching the copter forward or backward and causing it to move in that direction. It's a great control system and a pleasure to fly.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative Forward Propulsion System</strong><br />If you look carefully at the Dark Blade, you'll see two small side propellers that would appear to push the copter forward. Actually these side propellers are purely cosmetic. All the forward action happens with the small rear propeller hidden <em>beneath</em> the tail. This propeller then spins to pitch the Dark Blade copter forward or backward. In most small 3-Channel R/C copters the rear propeller needs to be mounted at some distance from the top rotors to get enough leverage to pitch the copter, this forces the helicopter design to be longer. However, the tail above the rear rotor in the Dark Blade acts to magnify the thrust of the propeller and allows a more compact 3-channel design.</p>

<p>Office disputes here at ThinkGeek are handled in a most diplomatic manner. As standard procedure, the offending parties are teleported to the surface of Vulcan where they duel to the death to resolve their differences. However due to the high employee turnover rate we have revised the policy to declare a victor based on Palmzsize Battle Tank warfare. These detailed diminutive r/c tanks feature authentic tank sounds and IR based ""laser tag"" action with realistic recoil. A hit momentarily disables your opponent. Get enough hits and take control of your enemy's tank. Each set contains two-tanks, but buy an extra set and up to four tanks can battle at once to solve those more complicated office disagreements.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong><br />We know you read directions... but just in case you don't, please realize that each tank can be set to any of four channels. But they must be set up in turn before the battle begins.</p>
<h6>Preparing for Battle</h6>
<ol type=""1"">
<li>Set the remote to the channel you desire (1-4) by using the switch on the left side</li>
<li>Turn on your tank, turn on the remote. The tank's light should be flashing red.</li>
<li>Push the small round button just below the ""on/off"" switch on the remote.</li>
<li>The tanks light now turns solid green. It is now set to the correct channel.</li>
<li>Repeat this procedure for each tank. If you turn the tank off, you will have to set the channel again.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Battle Modes</strong><br />On the front of each tank, next to the indicator LED light is a small button. Push this button after the tank's channel has been set and you can toggle between two battle modes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Mode (Indicator light is Green)</strong><br />5 hits by the enemy and your tank is immobilized.... you lose </li>
<li><strong>Capture Mode (Indicator light is Red)</strong><br />5 hits by the enemy and they take control of your tank. Your tank now behaves as if it is set to the same channel as your opponent's tank. Your opponent can drive and fire your tank. This is obviously most useful when 3 or 4 tanks battle. </li>

<p>Blackbeard was just about the most ruthless pirate ever. His management style was unique, to say the least. If one of his crew misbehaved, he would drop them in a large tank full of jellyfish and delight as the jewels he kept at the bottom of the tank reflected different colors into the ballet of agony that played out before him. According to the infamous pirate's diaries, it really calmed his nerves, too. Wow. Well, while we don't recommend all that for your office, there is something we can take from this story: colorful jellyfish are relaxing.</p>
<p>This desktop tank holds three jellyfish which ""swim"" around the tank (thanks to a gently contrived current). In the top of the tank are 6 bright LEDs, which let you set the mood. You can either have them blend softly from one color to the next, or stop on your favorite color. Either way, the jellies are happy to frolic in their kaleidoscopic, quiet menace. And if one of your subordinates ever acts up, just remind him or her about the Blackbeard story...and let them know there's room in your jellyfish tank for a hand or two. Sometimes threats are all you need. Arrrgh.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are having any troubles getting your jellies to swim about properly, remember to add just a few drops of liquid dish soap to the water as per the instructions. It's the part that makes the magic happen. Thanks!</p>

<p>With a diameter not much larger than a silver dollar and a single propeller on the bottom, the MicroFly somehow manages to hover in the air as it spins and flashes its blue LED. The simple slider control allows only up-and down movement... but this makes it so easy to fly that anyone can instantly control it.

<p>Pentago was developed in Sweden: the land of Vikings, ABBA, and Ikea. Following the simplicity of design Sweden is known for, Pentago has clean lines and simple game play. In fact, it has just two play steps. First, put down a marble. Second, rotate a quadrant. Get five marbles in a row and you win. That's it. Game play may be simple, but winning can be as hard as a Viking's axe. Because you can rotate quadrants, your mind has to plan out moves in so many different directions.</p>
<p>And just when you think you have everything thought out, your opponent rotates a quadrant and suddenly the whole board is different. Pentago is so cerebrally challenging, it won the Mensa Select Award in 2006 (as well as a bunch of other genius and game design awards). Each game board is handcrafted out of solid birch with aluminum accents and includes real glass marbles. Pentago is as beautiful as it is fun. And if you become a Pentago Master, no one will be able to deny you the title of ""genius!""</p>

<p>The date is 1974. The place? Budapest, Hungary. Erno Rubik, a passionate lecturer and admirer of geometry and 3D forms creates the world's most addictive and perfect puzzle - the Rubik's cube. It's now thirty years later and it's still the best selling puzzle in the Universe.</p>
<p>If you grew up when the Rubik's cube made it's debut - you probably remember that every kid had one. Whether it was the full size or the keychain version they were as common in school as cell phones and GBAs are these days. Elementary school kids could be seen solving them with their feet on 'That's Incredible!' and conspiracists believed the puzzle was an Eastern block tactic to distract American youth from their educations. In 1980 Cubaholics Anonymous was formally established. The eighties simply enjoyed RubikMania! Here we are in the 21st century and it's still just as addictive as it was thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Think you can solve it? Think you have what it takes to beat the reigning world record for solving the Rubik's cube? The first world champion was an American high school student who took the Budapest World Championship in 1982 by solving the puzzle in just 22.95 seconds! The latest 2003 winner was Dan Knights of San Francisco who used the 'Fridrich' system to beat the cube in just 20 seconds. Best of luck if you choose to delve into the realm of <a href=""http://www.speedcubing.com/"" target=""_BLANK"">competitive speedcubing</a>- you're gonna need it!</p>
<p><em>How complex can it really be ThinkGeek?</em><br />There are 43 quintillion possible combinations with your Rubik's cube. That's 43 million million millions. There are about 30 million seconds in a year. You would need over a thousand million years assuming you could look at a thousand patterns every second just to see all the possible combinations. So if you are interested, we recommend you get started now and hope that cryonics becomes true science.</p>

<p>In the future, everyone will only wear silver foil suits with big shoulder pads. We'll all have jobs with the word ""space"" in front of it (Space Accountant, Space Librarian, etc) and everything will be done with holograms. And in the future, Rubik's Cubes will also be shiny and silver. We tried to suck some from the future (using our ChronoSpatial Vaccuumatron), but something went wrong. We got the cubes, but they are a little . . . well, different.</p>
<p>Actually, they are exactly as they should be: silver and weird. While it functions just like a regular Rubik's Cube, the <em>Rubik's Mirror Blocks Cube</em> has different sized blocks - which means it gets very distorted very fast. Instead of puzzling out simple colors, you'll be trying to fight with geometric space, which is great fun. What is also great fun is seeing the look on the faces of others as they fiddle with your cube. <em>Rubik's Mirror Blocks Cube</em> - the future is here.</p>

<p>Since the dawn of time, shiny things have intrigued humankind. And ever since the first ape walked into a jewelry store, humans have loved crystals. They are delicate, they are beautiful, and understanding them is a key to advancing almost every branch of science. Now you can learn all about the beauty and wonder of crystals as you grow your own!</p>
<p>This kit has everything you need to grow 4 different types of crystal formations. Three of them grow in clusters and the fourth is a solitary crystal specimen. Growing crystals is super easy too, so you'll be having fun and enjoying the glittering fruits of your labor in hours and days (which is incredible considering it takes the Earth millions and millions of years). Take that, Planet Earth! And this crystal kit is the gift that keeps on giving, as once you've made your crystals, you can share (or sell) them. Learning and profit all rolled into one - isn't science grand?</p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> This kit also teaches you not to drink or eat chemicals included in crystal growing kits (so don't do it).</p>

<p>When you hear ""The Game of Life"" do you think of the Milton Bradley classic board game? If so... stop reading this and go back to geek school. However if you remember the cellular automation simulation invented by John Conway in the 1970's then we've got a cool little item for your DIY retro geek pleasure.</p>
<p>The game of life is set-up as a grid of ""cells"" following only four simple rules:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by loneliness.<br /><strong>2.</strong> Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.<br /><strong>3.</strong> Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.<br /><strong>4.</strong> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.</p>
<p>As the initiate amongst you no doubt recall, these rules lead to some cool evolving pixel based ""organisms"" like the glider, the blinker and the infamous glider factory. The Game of Life Kit allows you to build your own electronic LED based version of... the Game of life. You get a 4x4 grid of 16 LEDs that represents a small portion of the cellular grid. Push the button on the front and you reset the simulation and automatically populate it with random life. If all the cells die out completely the simulation automatically resets. The coolest part is that you can buy multiple kits and connect them together in any configuration to create a larger game board.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong><br />Assembly is definitely required. You'll need a soldering iron, some solder, wire clippers and a small amount of skill. It will take you about 30 minutes to assemble the kit.</p>

<p>Blocky table tennis with a ball and two paddles was one of the first real video games to make it into mainstream culture.

Simply place this seemingly dead ball of foliage in water and within hours it transforms into a vibrant green blood-sucking evergreen. Ok, we are kidding about the blood-sucking part. It's still amazing though! It's also great for lazy folks since you can forget to water your Dinosaur plant whenever you want! It will simply dry up and hibernate for up to fifty years and will spring to life every time it is given water.</p>
<p>Some Interesting Tidbits about your Dinosaur Plant:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the Carboniferous period these plants used to grow over 120 feet tall (bigger than a T-rex) </li>
<li>When dry it curls up into a tight ball so that the wind can easily roll it to a new location or cubicle, hopefully closer to moisture. </li>
<li>Retains 3% of its water when it is dehydrated. </li>
<li>Grows to be about 4"" </li>

We say we ""love this coffee mug,"" and sometimes we even imagine a face on the clock on the wall. It's called anthropomorphizing, and it's where we imbue human characteristics to inanimate objects.</p>
<p>But are they really inanimate? Certain mythologies suggest that the more we use and include these objects in our daily lives, the more connected they become with our lives, thoughts and feelings. They are pleased when we use them, and are sad when they're discarded. Think back to that stuffed monkey doll you had when you were a kid. You threw him away one day, and there he sits - vacuously staring at rotting garbage in a landfill for all eternity. Not very nice at all!</p>
<p>So some of these objects can be construed as to have a personality. Why not make it official? Stick a couple of googly eyes, and a goofy grin on a coffee mug, and hey-presto! Your happy smilin' coffee-buddy is happy to let you drink from his skull! That letter-scale looks a little like Domokun, doesn't he? I think that tape dispenser has something evil on his mind&hellip; Hmm&hellip;</p>
<p>Two sheets of eyes and mouths in various shapes, sizes and expressions, more than 100 stickers, are waiting for you to give life to the lifeless. That's sorta godlike!</p>

<p>Where would we be without Instant Messaging? It lets us stay in contact and chat with friends all over the world (especially delightful during work hours).

Don't be content with sharing images, jokes, and assorted links with your friends - it's time to share missiles!</p>
<p>You'll have your USB MSN Missile Launcher set up within minutes and that's when the fun begins. For you see, as you chat you and your buddies can control each other's launcher. And since each USB MSN Missile Launcher has an integrated webcam (which can be used as just a webcam if you haven't any buddies), you'll know exactly when you are aimed at your buddy's head. Then fire away! The only downside is that your buddy can do the same to you! The upside is, you can always retaliate by turning your buddy's USM MSN Missile Launcher to face the door of his office and peg his boss in the gut when he/she comes to lecture your buddy about using IM for non-work-related matters. Ah the joys of progress . . . and revenge.</p>

<p>These electromagnetic suspended globes are actually high-tech instruments. A magnetic field sensor continually measures the height at which the globes are suspended. This sensor feeds that data into a micro computer in the base of the unit. This computer then calibrates the electronic magnets at the top of the frame based on the distance between the globes and the top magnet to keep the globes correctly positioned. All in the blink of an eye! So not only do these look great on your desktop levitating in thin air, they are also technology marvels!</p>
<p>When you initially get your globe and plug it in, it may take you a few minutes to correctly position the globe in between the base and top magnets. You'll figure it out quickly enough and before you know it, you'll be able to set it up in just a few seconds every time. Once it's levitating, you can even spin it slightly and watch the globes rotate for extend periods of time. Just like the real thing, except you get to control gravity ;)</p>
<p>Your choice of either a 4"" or 8"" diameter globe. The 4"" model (8 inches tall including frame) features an attractive brushed metal silver frame. The 8"" globe (14.5 inches tall including frame) comes with a chrome finished frame with a black and multi-colored globe. The level of detail on the 8"" globe is greater than that of the 4"". Each comes with a power supply (US, 120V only). The 8"" model also features a red LED indicating power status built into the frame.</p>

<p>Of course it's using MAGIC to do so - the magic of magnetic repulsion and attraction that is. The Levitron is a magnetic anti-gravity top that is just as fun to setup as it is to watch in motion.</p>
<p>Basically, you just use the included top weights to adjust to the perfect weight (which varies from location to location and surface to surface), then you adjust the legs on the base. Then spin the top, slowly lift the lifter (with top on it) until the top escapes the platform and release! Voila. A top levitating in mid air. And depending on how well you set it up, it will spin up to five full minutes! Wave your hand underneath (or anything non-metallic), and amaze your family and co-workers! And all this with no batteries - sheer magnetic wizardry!</p>
<p>Of course it is not a piece of cake to setup. You have to observe it carefully as you are making the appropriate adjustments to the weight and to the base. It can be challenging but the reward is well worth it. Move the Levitron to another location though and you'll have to recalibrate the weights and levelers! Take the challenge and master it. It may take you five minutes, it may take longer.</p>
<p>Your Levitron arrives complete with:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Magnetic base w/three adjustable legs </li>
<li>One floating top </li>
<li>One lifter </li>
<li>One spinning plane </li>
<li>Several adjustment weights </li>
<li>Instruction sheet &amp; Levitron Physics guide </li>
</ul>
<p>Your choice of either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Omega Edition - Red/Black Molded Plastic </li>
<li>Note: The Cherry Wood Edition is no longer available. Sorry! </li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the high strength of the magnet in the base (and that it is purposely not shielded), ThinkGeek recommends you do not set the Levitron next to your monitor! Duh.</p>

FRAK!</h5>
<p>History lesson, boys and girls; everyone take their seats. In 1539, people were bored and poor. One day, Filius Giles of North Southwesteasternshire thought of a great way to pass the time. He took a chunk of lead (called a ""pohtaytoh"" by blacksmiths of the time) and heated it up. Gathering some friends, he dipped the pohtaytoh in lard with his tongs and threw it to his closest friend. The lard began melting away as each person threw it to another, hoping not to get burned by the ""hot pohtaytoh."" Apparently, everyone had a blast, and the game has survived today.</p>
<p>And now Hot Pohtaytoh has evolved into the Shock Ball. The Shock Ball plays just like the classic game - with one major alteration. This ball doesn't want you to win. It wants you to drop it and lose. And to get you to drop it, the Shock Ball (as you probably have guessed) shoots out random electrical shocks (and lights up to make the experience more enjoyable). If you can hold onto the Shock Ball, you will quickly become the Shock Ball Champ. And everyone will know you have nerves of steel and a very unique hairstyle (you know, from all the shocks). Shocking fun for everyone.</p>
<p>The Shock Ball is approx. 2.5"" in diameter,has an auto off function (for a modicum of safety), and uses 2 AAA batteries (not included).</p>
<p><strong>Warning: The Product Emits An Electric Shock. Keep out of reach of children. Not suitable for those under the age of 14. This is a novelty item, not a toy. May interfere with electrical devices such as pacemakers. </strong></p>

<p>This lovely desktop novelty needs little introduction, but we shall provide one so that we copywriters might keep our jobs. It's very simple. Just casually stick the shocking pen on your favorite co-worker's desk, then return to your own desk, go back to your or your ex's Facebook page, and patiently await. At some point, the presence of a novel looking thingy on the victims desk will stimulate their need to touch and interact with it. Much like a pickle might if it suddenly showed up on your desk.</p>
<p>The victim will then pick up the pen, and, without even a nub of conscious motion, their thumb will immediately migrate to depress the top of the pen in hopes of discovering a fine new writing instrument. Instead, as they depress, they will complete a circuit that creates a small magnetic field, which then simulates an alternating current and provides relatively high voltage to the depression point on the thumb. It all happens in a split second, as will the screech and instant profanity, but the office memories will last a lifetime...</p>
<p>Please note, this pen does not actually write as it contains no ink nor an appropriate tip to dispense said ink. So, I suppose we should have called it a 'Shocking Mock Pen' instead of a 'Shocking Pen' - but, oh well - you'll forgive us, right? To make you feel better we'll tell you that it's about 5.5 inches tall. Oh, and it's not for children. This is an adult novelty toy.

Neff</h5>
<p>What does it really take to run a successful company today? Thomas Neff and James Citrin, U.S. chairman and managing director, respectively, of the Spencer Stuart executive-search firm, offer revealing answers in <em>Lessons from the Top: The Search for America's Best Business Leaders</em>. In 50 short but perceptive profiles, they identify and analyze the men and women who drive today's most successful corporations. As might be expected, the authors lean heavily on well-known CEOs such as Steve Case of America Online, Michael Dell of Dell Computer, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks. But they also look at a number who don't get the same publicity, including Fannie Mae's Frank Raines, the Gap's Don Fisher, and Autodesk's Carol Bartz. The result is a broad but surprisingly consistent palette of personalities and philosophies that in a concluding section Neff and Citrin highlight by synthesizing into 10 common traits (passion, intelligence, communication skill, high energy, controlled ego, inner peace, a defining background, strong family life, positive attitude, and a focus on ""doing the right things right"") and six core principles (live with integrity, develop a winning strategy, build a great management team, inspire employees, create a flexible organization, and implement relevant systems). This book is for managers and anyone else looking for the patterns of success, both in and out of business. <em>--Howard Rothman</em> <em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</em></p>
<p><strong>From Publishers Weekly</strong><br />Headhunters Neff and Citrin of Spencer Stuart U.S. set out systematically to identify, profile, interview and capture the vision of the nation's top 50 CEOs. Through their company, they commissioned Gallup polls, gathered performance data and constructed a list of intangibles (""showed the ability to overcome challenges,"" ""demonstrated consistent strength of character,"" etc.). The final results don't look all that different on the surface from countless other books purporting to offer the managerial motherlode, but in this case the difference is in the details. Interviews with AT&amp;T's Mike Armstrong, Charles Schwab, Martha Ingram (one of four women named), Louis Gerstner, Bill Gates and Bill Marriott are all illuminating, revealing complementary aspects of captaining the ship without making redundant observations. A few of the notions even seem worker-centered: Starbucks' Howard Schultz points to the decision to provide equity and stock options to employees, even part-timers, as one of the main reasons why his company's attrition rate is below 60% annually (compared with the national average of 250%). The book is filled with such ideas, presented with a minimum of self-promotion from their purveyors. A final section of ""lessons learned"" offers a ""new definition of success"" that begins ""live with integrity and lead by example."" As concise and clear a management guide as readers are likely to find, this is a great tip sheet on business leadership.

<p>How to Use Google is a fun and detailed manual about all the Google functionality you didn't know existed! It is the most direct and instructional book about Google on the market today, and is written in an enjoyable magazine color format with high-quality screen shots.</p>
<p>How to Use Google contains specific examples for each Tip, Hack or Trick and contains active HTML links that take you directly to the web as you are learning.</p>
<p>What is Google and Why is it Important? Google is the world&rsquo;s largest and most powerful search engine. In other words, it&rsquo;s an incredible tool that allows you to locate a wide array of information on the Internet including websites, news, maps, phone numbers, stock quotes and much, much more.</p>
<p>Google is important it is our gateway to access information online. Every day more information is available electronically and we continue to discover new reasons to need access to that information. In fact, many people are finding themselves accessing Google 10, 20 or even 100 times a day. So given the usefulness of Google and the increasing importance of Google in our lives, you would expect users to understand how to use Google and all of its services. Unfortunately, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Most Google users only know how to perform basic Google searches and are actually quite inefficient in these efforts. As a result, most users are wasting their time, energy and money. This book is designed for beginner to intermediate level Google users who want to be more productive with Google. We will begin with an overview of how to maximize Basic Search, and then progress through advanced techniques, other types of search, and information on other Google services. Lastly we will reveal some Google hacks and tricks for more expert users.</p>

But really, the big problem comes when deciding how to make fun liquid get from outside your body to inside your body. Our favorite method is drinking. And when we drink, we like using straws. But sometimes a straight straw is boring. So we combined a few chemicals in a test tube and DIY Drinking Strawz were born.</p>
<p>Composed of 44 dishwasher safe components, DIY Drinking Strawz guarantee that liquids get into your body exactly how you want them to. Want to mix drinks? Well, then build your straw to dip into two (or more) cups. Want to share? Then build an extra drinking branch. Want to mix drinks AND share? You can do that too!!! Amazing, ain't it? And hey, if you want to go nuts and really suck, you can buy more than one set and make a mondo-gigantic straw. You could be the Suck-Meister.</p>

<p><em>But ThinkGeek, Can I Achieve World Domination With My Smart Mass?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Of course. All ThinkGeek products may be used to help you achieve World Domination. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our Smart Mass putty is just too much fun. Find out for yourselves how magically enticing and addictive playing with putty really is. As you find more and more ways to get creative with your putty, you'll, well, find more ways to get creative with everything! It's simply that stimulating!</p>
<p>Your choice of either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunburst (new!)</strong> - A Hypercolor! Heat sensitive putty. Jumpstart your day with some sunshine! Vibrant orange shifts into an awakening yellow with the touch of your hands or warmth from your coffee mug. Starts out Orange. </li>
<li><strong>Twilight (new!)</strong> - A Hypercolor! Heat sensitive putty. Just as an evening sky melts into the dark of night, this putty's deep purple color disappears with a touch to reveal a fluorescent blue complexion. </li>
<li><strong>Martian Sea</strong> - A color shifter that swirls deep clay reds and orange with a yellow to green sheen depending on the light. </li>
<li><strong>Dark Matter</strong> - A swirling mass of matte black. Your very own personal, warpable, black hole. Has magnetic properties: pull out a thin strand of dark matter and hold it near a magnet! </li>
<li><strong>Solar Blue</strong> - A very soothing and energetic, vibrant blue. Intoxicating. Cosmically rapturous... </li>
<li><strong>Oil Slick</strong> - A color shifter, Oil slick will look different in different lighting. From golds and yellow to pinks and emerald greens all swirling intelligently... </li>
<li><strong>Atomic Bronze</strong> - Lustrous comes to mind. Atomic bronze sparkles and commands attention. Your very own precious metal. Looks similar to Martian Sea, but has a much more metallic sheen to it. </li>
<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong> - Another color shifter. Atmosphere will morph into Cerulean highlights and features rich deep purples. A veritable alien, breathing, living atmosphere... </li>
<li><strong>Alien Ooze (glows!)</strong> - Military grade phosphors power this extremely powerful glowing mass. Charges in light or through UV sources. Amazingly bright when glowing. Ghost like when not performing... </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> - Your Smart Mass may seem like it has a mind of its own occasionally. That's because it does. And when not being used, your Smart Mass putty prefers to live in its comfortable tin where it can best plot World Domination Schemes.</p>

<p>Here are two little known facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The graphite pencil was first mass produced in the year 1662. </li>
<li>The first pencil sharpeners weren't made until 1893, which left many people disappointed by their pencil purchases for over 200 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first fact is a real fact; the second fact is a fake fact (that is, a joke). What can we say, the Walking Robot Pencil Sharpener has a very dry and unusual sense of humor. Our robot told us the above facts. And then it sharpened our pencil and walked away.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the coolest pencil sharpener ever to walk on its own. Just open its chest, insert a pencil, twist to sharpen, and remove your pointy pencil. By sharpening your pencil, you have secretly wound the 4"" robot's power core and it will now begin walking toward you (or in whatever direction it's facing). The shavings empty into the robot's cranial chamber, which can be easily opened for emptying. If you don't have a pencil handy, just use the included key to wind up the robot. Either way, your robot will walk with delight. Sorry if it proceeds to tell you bad jokes, though.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong>The robot will sharpen any regular pencil, but only some round pencils seem to wind it up. All hexagonal pencils, however, seem to give your robot the energy it needs to walk (pencils not included).</p>

Very few people on this planet have ever had the ability to go as far as Einstein has in comprehending the fundamental principles of the Universe. So we here at ThinkGeek think of that as sort of a super power worthy of the title 'Superhero Action Figure'. Sure he might not have been able to fly, breathe underwater or emit spider webs from his wrist - but he could melt your mind in a heartbeat with just a single attempt at explaining the Universe to you. Now that's power!</p>

<p>Ever since its release in 1980, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> has fueled the dreams of geeks across the world. Considered by many to be the best of the <em>Star Wars</em> saga, it was the first film where we really learned what it took to be a Jedi. Sure Obi Wan taught us a little in <em>A New Hope</em>, but it wasn't until we met Yoda that we truly realized how powerful the Force was and how hard it was to master. Yoda was the pinnacle of what a Jedi should be: mighty and humble, wise and peaceful. Even though he was tiny, we got glimpses of his immense power (really, I mean a whole X-Wing?!?)</p>
<p>Once we saw Yoda, we all knew we wanted a Jedi master of our own - a Jedi master who would take us running in the woods, ride on our back, and teach us the ways of the Force. We tried strapping a cat to our back, but it wasn't the same. A few months ago, our geeky hearts almost leapt out of our bodies when we saw this officially licensed backpack. Yoda&hellip;on our back&hellip;teaching us&hellip;and carrying our stuff inside him. Perfect! And, to make it even better, the straps are adjustable and sized for adults. All you need now is a dirty, sleeveless t-shirt and some khaki's and you will be ready for your Jedi training to begin. <em>You will be. You will be.</em></p>

<p>This is an enhanced edition of the HBR article R00506, originally published in September/October 2000. HBR OnPoint articles save you time by enhancing an original Harvard Business Review article with an overview that draws out the main points and an annotated bibliography that points you to related resources. This enables you to scan, absorb, and share the management insights with others. We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive review of the most influential theories on leadership--as well as workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders--the authors learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities: 1) They selectively reveal their weaknesses; 2) They rely heavily on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions; 3) They manage employees with ""tough empathy""; and 4) They capitalize on their differences. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, ""Be yourself--more--with skill.""</p>

<p>The technical sales professional fills a valuable role in the sales cycle of a software product.

It covers basics such as presentation skills, working in a team, and time management; specifics such as creating and delivering demos, working with groups of prospects, handling objections, and competitive positioning; and the overall technical sales cycle.

<p>Few cities rival Chicago in the skyline department-anyone who's been there will tell you it's got some of the world's most enthralling architecture-but it doesn't rest on its laurels as the birthplace of the skyscraper. The capital of the Midwest also boasts a gamut of top-rated museums, restaurants, and caf&eacute;s, and innumerable bars and nightclubs that pay homage to the city's strong jazz and blues heritage. Factor in the city's legacy as the training ground for stand-up comics like Jim Belushi and Bill Murray, and its heyday as Al Capone's headquarters, and it's easy to see why the Windy City makes such an exciting getaway.</p>

<p><strong>Fill It Up</strong><br />Fill up your iPod touch with audio and video from your iTunes library. All you have to do is choose the playlists, videos, and other content you want to sync, and iTunes does the rest.</p>
<h6>Movies and TV Shows</h6>
<p>Movies and TV shows have never looked this good on a portable device.</p>
<p><strong>Everything's a Must-see</strong><br />Carry hours of video with you, and watch it on a crisp, clear 3.5-inch widescreen color display. Need ideas? From Hollywood blockbusters to independent favorites, there's something for everyone at the iTunes Store. Download and watch movies with a few clicks. Prefer TV shows? Buy a single episode or an entire season's worth all at once.</p>
<p><strong>In Control</strong><br />While watching your video, tap the display to bring up the onscreen controls. You can play/pause, view by chapter, and adjust the volume. You also can use the new volume controls on the left side of iPod touch. Want to switch between widescreen and full screen? Simply tap the display twice.</p>
<p><strong>Sync and Go</strong><br />Need some entertainment for your next flight or road trip? With iTunes on your Mac or PC, you can sit at your computer and choose the movies and TV shows you want to sync to your iPod touch.</p>
<h6>Games</h6>
<p>With its groundbreaking technologies, iPod touch puts an amazing gaming experience in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p><strong>Get in the Game</strong><br />Developers all over the world are creating exciting games unlike anything you've ever seen on an iPod or mobile device. Many games come alive with stunning 3D graphics and immerse you in the action with the advanced technologies in iPod touch. There's even a built-in speaker, so you can hear all the action.</p>
<p><strong>Fingertip Control</strong><br />Many games for iPod touch use Multi-Touch to give you precise, fingertip control over game elements. Use your finger to drag your pieces around the board in chess or dice games. Or pinch to enlarge or shrink your view, rotate your character left or right, or just tap to make a selection.</p>
<p><strong>Tilt, Turn, and Go</strong><br />The built-in accelerometer actually responds to your movements, so you can tilt and turn your iPod touch to control the action. It's perfect for racing games--where your entire iPod touch acts as a steering wheel--and for tap-and-tilt games like Super Monkey Ball, in which your character rolls to your movements.</p>
<p><strong>The App Store</strong><br />Even if games aren't your thing, there's an iPod touch application for you. Thousands of applications in almost every category--entertainment, social networking, sports, photography, reference, and travel--are a tap away at the App Store.</p>
<h6>iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store</h6>
<p>Discover new music anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Buy on the Fly</strong><br />The built-in wireless capability in iPod touch gives you access to the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, where you can choose from millions of songs with a tap. Browse New Releases, What's Hot, and Genres. Take a look at Top Songs and Top Albums. Or find exactly what you're looking for with a quick search. Play a 30-second preview of any song, then tap once to buy it. Your music starts downloading instantly, and you can keep tabs on its progress by tapping the Downloads button.</p>
<p><strong>Sync it Back</strong><br />When you connect iPod touch to your computer, the music you bought on-the-go syncs to your iTunes library. If you've partially downloaded a song to iPod touch, your computer completes the download automatically.</p>
<p><strong>iPod touch at Starbucks</strong><br />If you have an iPod touch, an iPhone, or a computer with the latest version of iTunes, you get free Wi-Fi access to the iTunes Store and to Starbucks' Now Playing content. Stroll into a participating Starbucks, and you're connected automatically.</p>
<h6>Home Screen</h6>
<p>Get instant access to whatever you need on your iPod touch.</p>
<p><strong>Customize Your Home Screen</strong><br />Arrange the icons on your Home screen any way you want. Even move them to another Home screen. Create up to nine Home screens for quick access to the games and applications you download from the App Store and to your Safari Web Clips.</p>
<p><strong>Go Home</strong><br />No matter where you are on iPod touch, you can press the Home button to return to the Home screen. You can go back to what you were doing at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Add Apps, Web Clips, and More</strong><br />Whenever you download an application from the App Store, a new icon appears on your Home screen. And if you check the same websites every day, just create Web Clips and you can access the sites directly from your Home screen with a single tap. Not happy with how they're organized? Reorder them any way you want by dragging them around the screen.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5647?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<h6>Safari</h6>
<p>iPod touch features Safari, the most advanced web browser ever on a portable device.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Anywhere</strong><br />The iPod touch is the only iPod with 802.11b/g wireless access to the web. Whenever you're connected via Wi-Fi, you can access your favorite websites to read news, check scores, pay bills, and go shopping.</p>
<p><strong>Search and Find</strong><br />iPod touch syncs your bookmarks from your PC or Mac, so you can access favorite sites quickly. It has Google and Yahoo! search built in, so it's easy to find what you're looking for on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom with a View</strong><br />Get a closer look at any web page by zooming in and out with a tap or a pinch of the Multi-Touch display. View websites in portrait or landscape. Rotate iPod touch 90 degrees and the website rotates, too.</p>
<p><strong>Clip it.</strong><br />If you check a website frequently--a favorite newspaper, blog, or sports site--why not create a Home screen icon for it? Make Web Clips with Safari, and your favorite sites are always just a tap away.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5648?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<h6>Mail</h6>
<p>Email on iPod touch looks and works just like email on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>See it All</strong><br />iPod touch supports rich HTML email, so images and photos appear alongside text. And you see email attachments in their original formats, not stripped-down versions. Rotate, zoom, and pan in more than a dozen standard file and image formats, including PDF; Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; and iWork.</p>
<p><strong>Access it All</strong><br />Access your email from popular providers--including MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo! Mail, Google Gmail, and AOL--and most industry-standard IMAP and POP mail systems.</p>
<p><strong>Send Fast</strong><br />iPod touch recognizes email addresses in different applications. If you run across an email address on a web page or a map listing, for example, just tap it; iPod touch opens a new message and addresses it for you.</p>
<p><strong>Type Smart</strong><br />With its built-in dictionary, the intelligent iPod touch keyboard predicts and suggests words as you type, making it fast and easy to write email.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5649?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<h6>Maps</h6>
<p>When you're connected via Wi-Fi, you can get directions, find local businesses, and check traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Find Yourself</strong><br />iPod touch finds your location using known Wi-Fi hotspots. It also finds points of interest by keyword: Search for ""coffee"" and iPod touch shows you every cafe nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Get Directions</strong><br />Just type in an address and get directions from wherever you are. View a list of turn-by-turn directions, or see a highlighted map route. You also can mark specific locations and find the best route between them.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the View</strong><br />Just like Google Maps on your computer, Maps on iPod touch lets you switch between views of Google map data, satellite images, and a hybrid of both. Multi-Touch makes the difference. Tap to zoom, pan, and change your view on the move.</p>
<p><strong>See Traffic</strong><br />Maps on iPod touch shows you live traffic information, indicating traffic speed along your route in easy-to-read green, red, and yellow highlights.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5650?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<h6>YouTube</h6>
<p>Love to watch the latest YouTube videos? iPod touch gives you all the fun of the web's best videos--pocket-size.</p>
<p><strong>Share from Anywhere</strong><br />Email your favorite videos to your favorite people. Tap ""Share"" on any YouTube video detail page, and iPod touch creates an email with the video link already in it.</p>
<p><strong>Watch What You Want</strong><br />Explore Featured, Most Viewed, Most Recent, and Top Rated videos. Or search for the video you want with a keyword search. Once you find what you're looking for, bookmark it to watch later.</p>
<h6>Photos</h6>
<p>Carry up to 25,000 of your favorite photos everywhere.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5651?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<p><strong>Share Photos</strong><br />Show thousands of photos from the palm of your hand. Flick to scroll through thumbnails. Tap to view full screen. Rotate to see a photo in landscape. Pinch to zoom in or out. Play slideshows, complete with music and transitions. Email a photo to a friend, set it as your wallpaper, or share it in a MobileMe Gallery.</p>
<p><strong>Save Photos</strong><br />If you receive a great image in an email, save it to your photo library on iPod touch. Once there, it acts just like any other photo. You can set it as your wallpaper, share it on the web, or pass it on.</p>
<p><strong>Sync Photos</strong><br />iPod touch uses iTunes to sync photos you have in iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album on a PC. Just choose which photos or albums to sync to your iPod touch, then you can look at them--and share them--anywhere you go.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5652?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<h6>Calendar</h6>
<p>With iPod touch, it's easy to make plans and stay on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Add Events</strong><br />Keep your schedule at your fingertips with iPod touch. Add events to your calendar. Set a custom alert. Write a note or two. Manage multiple color-coded calendars. And do it all with just a few taps.</p>
<p><strong>Stay in Sync</strong><br />Connect iPod touch to your computer, and the events that you've created on-the-go automatically sync to Microsoft Outlook on a PC or iCal on a Mac. And all the events you've added on your computer sync to iPod touch.</p>
<p><strong>Three Ways to View</strong><br />iPod touch gives you three ways to view your calendars. List view shows you all your appointments in the coming days as a comprehensive list, which you can scroll up and down. Day view displays one day's worth of appointments visually. And Month view offers an at-a-glance look at an entire month.</p>
<h6>Contacts</h6>
<p>Put names, email addresses, phone numbers, and more at your fingertips.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5653?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<p><strong>Make Contact</strong><br />Build your contacts list on your Mac with Address Book or on your PC with Microsoft Outlook, then sync everything to your iPod touch using iTunes. You also can add contact information directly to your iPod touch from maps, web pages, and email. Next time you sync, your computer is updated, too.</p>
<p><strong>Search Contacts</strong><br />If you have a lot of contacts, a quick search shows you a list of matching names. Or you can scroll up and down your entire list to find the right contact. Want to send them an email? Just tap an email address and the Mail application opens automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Organized by Groups</strong><br />If you keep your contacts organized into groups--such as co-workers, friends, family, and so on--iPod touch will, too. And iPod touch can hold more than just names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You also can track birthdays, websites, nicknames, and notes.</p>
<h6>Stocks, Weather, and Notes</h6>
<p>Stay on top of it all.</p>
<p><strong>Check Stocks</strong><br />Stocks on iPod touch shows you performance information for any stock you choose. When you want more details about a stock's performance, tap the Y! for instant access to Yahoo! Finance.</p>
<p><strong>Get Weather</strong><br />Check worldwide weather at home or away. Add the cities you want, then flick back and forth to get six-day forecasts for each. Tap the Y! to open a Yahoo! city guide that shows you what's happening, rain or shine.</p>
<p><strong>Take Notes</strong><br />Forget the pen and paper. Use Notes on iPod touch to write yourself a quick note and keep important information on hand. There's even a built-in email function that lets you send notes to yourself or others.</p>
<h6>Calculator</h6>
<p>iPod touch's calculator helps you settle the restaurant bill or keep track of your budget.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate Simply</strong><br />When you tap the Calculator icon, iPod touch shows you a simple application with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and memory functions. Use it just as you would a pocket calculator.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate Scientifically</strong><br />Your simple calculator doubles as a sophisticated scientific calculator. Just rotate it to landscape to access dozens of functions for solving complex science and math problems.</p>
<p><img src=""http://app.ecwid.com/image/5654?ownerid=1003"" border=""0"" alt="""" /></p>
<h6>Nike + iPod</h6>
<p>Get the most out of your workout.</p>
<p><strong>Tune Your Run</strong><br />iPod touch now includes built-in Nike + iPod support. Just slip the Nike + iPod Sensor (available separately) into your Nike+ shoe and start your run. The sensor communicates wirelessly with your iPod touch, tracking your time, distance, and calories burned. It even gives you voice feedback on your progress.</p>
<p><strong>Tune Your Cardio Workout</strong><br />This feature also works with new cardio equipment available in many fitness centers. Just look for treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, and stationary bikes that are Nike + iPod compatible.</p>
<p><strong>Sync with Nikeplus.com</strong><br />When you get back to your computer, sync your iPod touch via iTunes and transfer your exercise data to nikeplus.com, where you can track your workouts, set goals, and challenge friends.</p>
<h6>Multi-Touch</h6>
<p>iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>Glide, Flick, Pinch</strong><br />Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the Multi-Touch touchscreen interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, zoom in and out on a section of a web page, and control game elements precisely.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />The Multi-Touch display layers a protective shield over a capacitive panel that senses your touch using electrical fields. It then transmits that information to the LCD screen below it. iPod touch software enables the flick, tap, and pinch.</p>
<p><strong>Type with the Touchscreen Keyboard</strong><br />iPod touch features an intelligent touchscreen keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, getting directions on a map, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts. It analyzes keystrokes to suggest words as you type and correct spelling errors automatically. And because it's software based, it changes its keys to support typing in multiple languages.</p>
<h6>Accelerometer</h6>
<p>iPod touch responds to motion using a built-in accelerometer.</p>
<p><strong>Responds to Movement</strong><br />iPod touch detects when you rotate it from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display. So you immediately see the entire width of a web page, view a photo in its proper aspect ratio, or control a game using only your movements.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />The accelerometer inside iPod touch uses three elements: a silicon mass, a set of silicon springs, and an electrical current. The silicon springs measure the position of the silicon mass using the electrical current. Rotating iPod touch causes a fluctuation in the electrical current passing through the silicon springs. The accelerometer registers these fluctuations and tells iPod touch to adjust the display accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect for Gaming</strong><br />Accelerometer technology really shines when you play games because it immerses you in the action. It's perfect for racing games--where your entire iPod touch acts as a steering wheel--and for tap-and-tilt games like Super Monkey Ball, in which your character responds to your every movement.</p>
<h6>Wireless</h6>
<p>Connect iPod touch to the Internet anywhere there's a wireless network.</p>
<p><strong>Connect Automatically</strong><br />iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots, including protected networks. If you've never used a particular network, it asks you to enter a password the first time, and it remembers the password from then on. So the next time you're within range, it connects automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Surf's Up</strong><br />Now you can send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Shop for games from your couch. Browse, buy, and download music from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at select Starbucks locations or other wireless hotspots in your area.</p>

Its built-in wireless capability gives you access to the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, where you can buy songs with a tap. Browse New Releases, What's Hot, Genres, and Top 10 songs. Or find exactly what you're looking for with a quick search. Tap a song to preview it, tap Buy to purchase it. Even redeem your iTunes gift cards and gift certificates. All from anywhere you happen to be.</p>
<p><strong>Starbucks Music</strong><br />You walk into a Starbucks. Order your latte. While you wait, you hear a song wafting from the loudspeakers. You love it. So you get out your iPod touch and buy it over Wi-Fi. Just like that. The iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store on iPod touch tells you what's playing in select Starbucks and lets you buy it along with other featured Starbucks content. So you can sip, shop, and listen.</p>
<p><strong>Home Screen</strong><br />Make the iPod touch Home screen your own. Change what's in the Dock. Rearrange the icons. And make room for even more. You can add up to eight Home screen pages and fill them with Web Clips.</p>
<h6>Internet</h6>
<p><br />Surf the web. Send email. Get directions and find your location with Maps. Check stocks, weather, and more. iPod touch is not just an amazing iPod. It's the Internet in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Safari</strong><br />iPod touch is the only iPod with wireless access to the web. Safari is built in, so you see websites the way they were designed to be seen. Search the web using the touchscreen keyboard. Zoom in and out by tapping the multi-touch display. Switch between portrait or landscape view, depending on how you hold your iPod touch. Sync your bookmarks. Better yet, add them to your Home screen. iPod touch can automatically create a Web Clip on your Home screen from any of your favorite websites. So just one tap takes you directly there.</p>
<p><strong>YouTube</strong><br />Got a bit of a YouTube addiction? iPod touch feeds it from anywhere with a special YouTube player built right in. Watch featured videos, check out the most viewed, search for something specific, then bookmark your favorites for future reference. It's all the fun of YouTube--pocket-size.</p>
<p><strong>Mail</strong><br />iPod touch is the first iPod with Mail. And it's the best email you've ever seen on a handheld device. This mail application lets you view rich HTML email with graphics and photos displayed inline, as well as PDF, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Excel attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Maps</strong><br />Get directions and check traffic with Google Maps. Even find yourself, wherever you are. Using some local Wi-Fi networks (if Wi-Fi is turned on), iPod touch finds your approximate location and gives directions from there. Mark specific locations, find the best route between them, and search for points of interest along the way. With a hybrid map and satellite view, you can see major street names on top of satellite images.</p>
<p><strong>Widgets</strong><br />Widgets are small, incredibly handy applications you can use every day. Three of the most useful widgets now live front and center on your Home screen:</p>

<h6>High Technology</h6>
<p><br />iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone, the most advanced software ever engineered, and state-of-the-art technology. With the multi-touch display, you can control everything using only your fingers. If you rotate your iPod touch from portrait to landscape, the accelerometer automatically changes the way the content is displayed. And with wireless technology, you can connect to the Internet from any Wi-Fi network, anywhere you are.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-touch</strong><br />iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone. Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the multi-touch interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, or zoom in and out on a section of a web page. And iPod touch features a touchscreen QWERTY keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, getting directions on a map, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Ambient Light Sensor</strong><br />The iPod touch display has an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness to suit the ambient light in your surroundings. The result? A better experience for you and battery-saving efficiency for iPod touch.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless</strong><br />Connect to the Internet anywhere there's a Wi-Fi network. Send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Browse, buy, and download music from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at select Starbucks locations or other wireless hot spots in your area. iPod touch finds wireless networks and connects you to the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accelerometer</strong><br />An accelerometer detects when you rotate iPod touch from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display, so you immediately see the entire width of a web page, your music in Cover Flow, or a photo in its proper aspect ratio.</p>
